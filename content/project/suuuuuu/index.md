Small funny, responsive website with just a big button to hear how Cristiano yells "Suuuuuuuuuuu".

Only requires a mere 775 bytes of JS download size to hook up the button with the browser's Audio API, plus 943 bytes of CSS download to make the (very) simple styles to work out both in desktop and mobile.
