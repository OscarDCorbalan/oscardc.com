Chromatic TD (TD = Tower Defense) is a game, developed in ActionScript, with the objective of stopping the enemies from crossing the map by building different elements (towers) that fire or have effects over enemies or other towers, which make strategy and construction planning key elements. Each enemy killed gives credits that allow building new elements or upgrading existing ones.

## Level editor

The game includes a level editor that can be integrated with REST APIs of any web portal (e.g. Kongregate), so the players registered in it can save, load and share their creations, offering an infinite re-playability.

## Technologies used

Chromatic Tower Defense is implemented in ActionScript 3.0, which allows to play it in any browser but also to compile the code for any platform: Linux, Android, iOS, Windows, etc.
