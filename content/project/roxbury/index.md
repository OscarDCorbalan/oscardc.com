Roxbury: The Club was a pub-disco in Mataro (Barcelona), aimed at a young clientele.

They required a page that remembered a night/party atmosphere, being colorful and accommodating requirements such as an integrated music player.

## Technologies

The web is built with Flash to get the dynamism that only it could offer, but with custom ActionScript classes that import content and feeds from HTML and XML files. This makes updating the site a breeze without needing to recompile the source code.
