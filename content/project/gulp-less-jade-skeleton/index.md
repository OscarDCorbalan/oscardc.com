Skeleton with the necessary tools and configuration to start building ASAP a web application based on LESS and Jade templates.

Packs Gulp with a configured webserver that autoreloads when any change is made in the source code.

Everything needed for production is packed into a /public directory, so you can easily configure the step to copy it to your server.

## Technologies used

The static site is pre-generated using a system of templates in Jade and styles through LESS, as well as Node.js + Gulp to automate the whole process, obtaining zero duplicate code although being a multi-language site.

* Gulp.
* LESS.
* Jade.
* CSS minification.
