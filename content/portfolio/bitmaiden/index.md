Bit Maiden was a web portal in the indie videogames niche; that is, created only with the own resources of the development team, without any editor or publisher backing. The portal had both an informative side (news, reviews, etc) and the possibility to play Flash and HTML5 games.

## A success history

World-wide, it became the second top reference in its niche, just after Indie Games Mag and its various related portals, with a thriving community that was born around it, with peaks of 20-25 thousand pageviews per day.

### Monetization

The monetization was a mix of standard ad income (Intergi, mixed with Google AdWords and other smaller networks) and affiliate purchases. Affiliate sales were achieved by in-game money spent in games available at Bit Maiden, as well as regular links to buy the games mentioned by our articles.

We also were one of the first portals to integrate video advertising in the videogame niche, which had very high CPM at the moment because almost no website supported it -there still was no "download this JS and it works"... we had to implement it ourselves!

## Technologies used

Bit Maiden was built on top of Wordpress, but also had custom web scrappers, implemented in PHP, that did daily checks to the prices of various online sellers:

* Steam.
* Good Old Games.
* GreenMan Gaming
* Gamers Gate
* Comission Junction
* etc

This allowed it to always pick the best offer and allow users to buy at the best price through us, building a custom affiliate link software integrated as a Wordpress plugin.
