Web created for a taxi driver of the Alcaidesa municipality, a Spanish high-income tourist place with lits of golf courses, an awesome seaport and polo tournaments.

The website follows a mobile-first -which is the main customer- philosophy to have an unbeatable mobile visualization, and everything is optimized to be able to load in record time even without 3G connection coverage, up to the point of locating the best datacenter in the zone for hosting. It also includes everything needed to optimize robot crawling: microdata, hreflang tags, etc.
