Dungeon Realms is a game designed by Jos√© Carlos de Diego, one of most prolific Spanish game designers. It's a card game for 2 players with deck-building in conjunction with worker placement and resource management.

## The Gameplay

Each player impersonates an adventurer who tries to gather enough money and experience to become the next champion of the mark, by reaching any of the multiple victory conditions (experience gain, killing multiple dragons, etc).

Each adventurer starts the game with only 9 pityful cards. Every round starts with 5 cards in hand and plays by alternating turns, in which workers are placed to try to battle for and win more resources like extra cards for future rounds, money or experience.

As the game advances, various 'Ages' pass and the gains and enemies become bigger and badder.

## Technologies used

The game is implemented in ActionScript plus the AIR Framework, which makes it multiplatform (Windows, Linux, Android, iOS). Dungeon Realms is multilanguage, thanks to XML-coded texts and cards, and offers online multiplayer support thanks to a custom-implemented NodeJS server based in sockets.
