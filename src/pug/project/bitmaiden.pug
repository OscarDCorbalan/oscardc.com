					p
						| Bit Maiden was a web portal in the indie videogames niche; that is, created only with the own resources of the development team, without any editor backing.
						| The portal had both an informative side (news, reviews, etc) and the possibility to play only Flash and HTML5 games.
					p
						| World-wide, it became the second top reference in its niche, just beyond Indie Games Mag and its various related portals, and a thriving community was built around it,
						| with peaks of 20-25 thousand pageviews per days.
					p
						| The monetization was a mix of standard ad income (Intergi, mixed with Google AdWords and other smaller networks) and affiliate purchases.
						| Affiliate sales were achieved by in-game money spent in games available at Bit Maiden, as well as regular links to buy the games mentioned by our articles.
						| Bit Maiden also had custom web scrappers that cached daily the prices of various online sellers (Steam, GoodOld Games, GreenMan Gaming...), that allowed
						| it to always pick the best offer and allow users to buy at the best price through us.
